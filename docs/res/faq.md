No. Whether you are from a university or have just completed your A levels, no one has an upper hand in the selection process. We do not consider your educational background. During the training program, everyone is taught equally, from the basics to advanced levels. Regardless of whether you have a bachelor's degree or not, you will be taught and treated the same.

### 9- What is the requirement regarding the baccalauréat for candidates applying for the training program?
To be eligible for the training program, a valid baccalauréat certificate is necessary. Unfortunately, applicants who have not obtained their baccalauréat will not be considered for this program.

### 10- Is it possible for individuals below the age of 17 to participate in the training program?
Yes, individuals below the age of 17 are not eligible to participate in the pre-employment training program.
Additionally, one of the reasons for the age requirement is that the trainee program aims to prepare participants for potential employment opportunities. To be eligible for employment and sign a contract in accordance with the laws and regulations of Cameroon, individuals must typically be at least 18 years old. Therefore, the age restriction ensures that candidates who successfully complete the program are of legal working age and can be considered for job opportunities that may arise.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive and rewarding learning experience for trainees, preparing them for a successful career in software development. We remain committed to fostering a positive learning environment for all applicants who meet the eligibility criteria and are of legal working age.

We encourage younger individuals to explore other educational opportunities available to them, and we will be glad to consider their application once they meet the age requirements. Thank you for your understanding.

If you do not meet these criteria, it is unlikely that you would qualify for this particular training program.

### 12- Are there opportunities available for students who are already in University or possess the necessary qualifications but are not writing the Advanced Level Exams this year?
